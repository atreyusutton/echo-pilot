## 14. Brand Brief Inputs (Product Onboarding)

Capture these fields when a business connects Google so the AI can mirror their voice:
- **Voice sliders** – scale for warmth, formality, and energy (map to tone modifiers).
- **Signature** – closing line + name/title to append to every reply.
- **Taboo phrases** – words to avoid plus escalation triggers (e.g., “never mention refunds in replies”).
- **USP snippets** – 1–2 sentences describing what makes the business unique; weave into positive replies.
- **Service recovery policy** – preferred wording when a review is <4 stars (apology template, contact info).
- **Language preferences** – default language + whether bilingual replies are allowed.
