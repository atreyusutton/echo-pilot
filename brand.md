## 1. Brand Overview

**🔄 UPDATED POSITIONING (Jan 2026)**

EchoPilot is a text-based business management platform designed for busy small business owners. Manage your entire Google Business Profile via SMS—respond to reviews, update hours, post updates, request reviews—all without opening a dashboard.

**Core Value Proposition:** Bring business management to text.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **SMS-first:** Everything happens via text message (not another dashboard to check)
- **Always with you:** Your phone is always in your pocket
- **Instant:** Text is faster than logging into a dashboard
- **Simple:** Reply with A, E, or S—no complicated interface
- **AI as helper:** Get suggested replies, but you're always in control
- **More than reviews:** Manage hours, posts, stats, review requests—all via SMS

**Brand Tone:** Helpful, conversational, fast. Think "text from a friend" not "enterprise software."

**Visual Identity:** Clean, modern, mobile-first. Communicates speed, simplicity, and reliability.
