Hey [Name]! Love what you're doing with [Business]. I'm a Boulder 
local who just launched a tool that helps businesses like yours

Mind if I share more? Would be happy to offer a free trial since 
you're local! 🌲
```

**Instagram-Specific Tips:**

## 4. Email Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Local Connection
```
Subject: Built a review tool for Boulder businesses

Hi [Owner Name],

I'm [Your Name], a Boulder local who just launched EchoPilot — 
a tool that helps businesses like [Business Name] respond to 
every Google review automatically (but it still sounds like 
you, not a robot).

I noticed you have [X] reviews on Google. If you're spending 
time manually responding to each one, I'd love to show you 
how EchoPilot can save you 2+ hours a week.

Free trial for Boulder businesses through February?

Happy to stop by for a quick 15-min demo — I'm just up the 
street.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
echopilot.me
```

---

### Template 2: Problem-Focused
```
Subject: Saw your Google reviews — quick question

Hi [Owner],

I was checking out [Business Name]'s Google reviews 
(awesome ratings!) and noticed you haven't responded to 
some recent ones.

Responding to every review can boost your local SEO by 
15-20% and show customers you care — but it's super 
time-consuming.

I built EchoPilot to solve this for Boulder businesses. 
It automatically drafts replies in your voice, and you 
can approve/edit via text (no need to open a dashboard).

Want a 15-min demo? I'm in Boulder and happy to stop by 
with coffee.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
[Phone]
echopilot.me
```

---

### Template 3: Social Proof
```
Subject: How [Competitor] is managing their Google reviews

Hi [Owner],

I recently helped [Similar Business] in Boulder automate 
their Google review responses, and they're saving 3+ hours 
a week.

Thought it might be useful for [Your Business] too, 
especially with [X] reviews to manage.

EchoPilot handles the replies automatically (but still 
sounds human), and you can approve/edit everything via text.

Free demo? I'll bring the coffee ☕

Best,
[Your Name]
```
