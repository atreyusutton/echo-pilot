# 3. HOW IT WORKS

Use `stacked_logo.png` above this section as a section header.

### Step 1 — Connect  
Securely sign in with Google and select your verified locations.  
EchoPilot only requests the **business.manage** scope and never modifies settings outside of review replies.

### Step 2 — Set tone  
Customize your brand voice:
- Friendly  
- Professional  
- Neutral  
- Playful  
- Apologetic  

Add your signature and optional taboo phrases.

### Step 3 — Autopilot  
EchoPilot drafts thoughtful owner replies and posts them using Google’s approved API workflow.  
You may enable manual approval during verification periods.

### Visual Aid  
Insert `flow.png` showing conceptual user flow.
